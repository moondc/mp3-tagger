Allows you to manage mp3 tags on your filesystem.
Also allows you to bulk rename files based on patterns (TODO)

Made for windows file system paths

Make sure your directories only contain music files and not hidden system files (otherwise recursive folder scanning features won't work)

1. then `npm run start` both
